# A-Control-Method-for-Merging-Trucks-from-the-Acceleration-Lane-into-the-Mainline-Platoon

This code requires Python 3.7 or higher, and the following dependencies must be installed: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, gym, and highway-env. If needed, gymnasium can be installed as a substitute for gym.

Run merge_env.py to start the program. The rule-based algorithm employed by this program successfully enables ramp trucks to merge into the mainline truck platoon within the acceleration lane area.
